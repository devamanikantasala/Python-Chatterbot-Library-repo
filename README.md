# Python-Chatterbot-Library-repo
I don't own any of these files all of the Chatterbot library rights goes to `gunthercox` and the relevent dependencies belong to their own and I don't own or claim any rights, these are the files that are useful incase if you are having trouble to install Chatterbot. I created this repo-help myself &amp; myfellow friends to work on lib in codespaces.
